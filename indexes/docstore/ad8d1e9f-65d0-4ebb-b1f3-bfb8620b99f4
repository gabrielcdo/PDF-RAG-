To address this, we compared two different approaches to analyze our task-level classifications: measuring the total number of conversations per task (as discussed in the main text) vs. measuring the unique user accounts per task.\n\nAs shown in Figure 10, the patterns of AI usage across occupations remain remarkably stable regardless of which approach we use. This suggests our findings are not affected by variation in interaction patterns across occupations.\n\nB.3 Usage by Wage and Barrier to Entry\n\nWage Occupations in O*NET contain associated data on the median wage of workers in that occupation.10 To analyze occupational usage of AI relative to occupations\u2019 wage, we mapped each occupation\u2019s conversation count to the median salary of that occupation.\n\nBarrier to entry Occupations in O*NET are placed into one of five Job Zones which describe the amount of preparation a person would need for a given occupation. O*NET delineates the Job Zones as:\n\nJob Zone 1 - occupations that need little or no preparation Job Zone 2 - occupations that need some preparation\n\n10This information is included on the O*NET website but at the time of writing this paper, we did not find it readily available in a downloadable format. We instead rely on data from Kilbourne-Quirk [2019], which scraped the O*NET website to obtain this occupation-specific wage data.\n\n19\n\nJob Zone 3 - occupations that need medium preparation Job Zone 4 - occupations that need considerable preparation Job Zone 5 - occupations that need extensive preparation\n\nOccupations are placed into job zones via assessments of their necessary education, related experience, job training, and specific vocational preparation\u2014\"the amount of lapsed time required by a typical worker to learn the techniques, acquire the information, and develop the facility needed for average performance in a specific job-worker situation.\"\n\nExample occupations for each job zone are:\n\nJob Zone 1 - dishwashers, baristas, and agricultural equipment operators Job Zone 2 - customer service representatives, security guards, and tellers Job Zone 3 - electricians, medical assistants, and barbers Job Zone 4 - real estate brokers, sales managers, and database administrators, Job Zone 5 - pharmacists, lawyers, and biologists\n\nThe O*NET website contains further details on requirements for each job zone and example occupa- tions [National Center for O*NET Development, 2025a].", "type": "Document"}}
