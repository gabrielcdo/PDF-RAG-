These metrics provide complementary views of how well the cluster-based categorization aligns with analysis on conversations directly.\n\n29\n\nSpecifically, when comparing direct assignment to cluster-based approaches, we observe minimum correlation values of 0.70 (Pearson), 0.58 (Spearman), and 0.46 (Kendall\u2019s Tau-b). These correlations are calculated only for occupations that have associated tasks identified by at least one method.\n\nWe visualize these relationships in several ways. Figure 17 directly compares the prevalence of occupations between direct assignment and cluster-based approaches at different aggregation levels. Figure 18 shows how occupation prevalence varies across all aggregation levels, while Figure 19 presents the correlation metrics alongside mean squared error measurements. Figure 20 shows the difference in usage by median salary between direct assignment and cluster assignment.\n\nGiven the significant overlap between many tasks and occupations in the O*NET database, we expect that the two methods would identify somewhat different sets of tasks and their associated occupations. Figure 21 illustrates this pattern, showing which occupations were identified by each method and where these sets overlap.\n\nAvg. Cluster Size 50 Avg. Cluster Size 100 Avg.
