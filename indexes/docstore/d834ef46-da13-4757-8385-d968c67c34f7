We include the number of Claude.ai conversations used and the time span from which these conversations were sampled.\n\nAnalysis Conversations Time Span Usage Across Tasks and Occupations (Section 3.1) 1M 2024-12-16 to 2024-12-23 Usage by Wage and Barrier to Entry (Section 3.3) 1M 2024-12-16 to 2024-12-23 Usage by Skills (Section 3.2) 500K 2025-01-10 to 2025-01-17 Automating vs. Augmenting Users (Section 3.4) 1M 2024-12-16 to 2024-12-23 Usage by Model Type (Section 3.5) 1M 2024-12-15 to 2025-01-04\n\nF Prompts\n\nBelow, we provide our complete prompts for specific analyses and components as outlined above.\n\nF.1 Screening for Occupationally-Relevant Conversations\n\nBelow is the prompt for the screening process used to determine if a conversation is occupationally relevant as described in Appendix B.\n\nHuman: The following is a conversation between Claude, an AI assistant, and a user:\n\n{conversation}\n\nAssistant: I understand.\n\nHuman: Your job is to answer this question about the preceding conversation:\n\n<question>\n\n24\n\nDoes the conversation possibly involve an occupational task? </question>\n\nWhat is the answer? You MUST answer either only \"Yes\" or \"No\". Provide the answer in <answer> tags with no other commentary.\n\nAssistant: Sure, the answer to the question is: <answer>\n\nF.2 Mapping Conversations to O*NET Tasks\n\nHuman: The following is a conversation between Claude, an AI assistant, and a user:\n\n{conversation}\n\nAssistant: I understand.\n\nHuman: Consider the following list of classification options:\n\n<options> {options_str} </options>\n\nYour job is to identify which option best describes the previous conversation. In this case, the provided options are occupational tasks. Your job is to identify which task is performed by the assistant in the previous human-AI assistant conversation.\n\nWhat is the answer? You MUST provide an option exactly as written above. If multiple options apply, choose the single-most pertinent one. First, start off by considering various aspects of the conversation in <scratchpad> tags in at most four sentences, and then provide the final answer in <answer> tags with no other commentary.\n\nAssistant:", "type": "Document"}}
