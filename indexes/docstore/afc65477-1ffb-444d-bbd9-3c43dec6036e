Our analysis of millions of conversations on Claude.ai reveals clear patterns: AI usage peaks in software development and technical writing, with \u223c4% of occupations showing usage across three-quarters of their tasks and \u223c36% showing usage in at least a quarter of their tasks. Usage splits nearly evenly between automation (43%) and augmentation (57%) of human capabilities. While these patterns are informative, they capture just the beginning of AI\u2019s integration into work. As AI systems expand beyond text to handle video, speech, and physical actions through robotics, and as AI agents become more capable of carrying out extended tasks autonomously, the nature of human-AI collaboration is poised to transform dramatically. New tasks and even entirely new occupations may emerge around these capabilities. Empirical frameworks that track these changes dynamically will be crucial for anticipating and preparing for the evolving landscape of work. The challenge ahead lies not just in measuring these changes, but in using our understanding of them to help shape a better future.\n\n6 Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Avital Balwit, Landon Goldberg, Logan Graham, Zac Hatfield-Dodds, Andrew Ho, Kamya Jagadish, Rebecca Lee, Liane Lovitt, Jennifer Martinez, Andi Peng, Ankur Rathi, Orowa Sikder, Colt Steele, Janel Thamkul, and Meg Tong for their helpful ideas, discussion, and feedback.
