The data is organized into Job Zones 1-5, representing increasing levels of occupational preparation requirements, from minimal (Zone 1) to extensive preparation (Zone 5). The columns represent:\n\n\u2022 Conv. %: The percentage of total usages falling within each zone\n\n\u2022 Base. %: The baseline percentage of occupations in each zone\n\n\u2022 Rep.

Correct errors by making appropriate changes and rechecking the program to ensure that the desired results are produced. Modify existing software to correct errors, allow it to adapt to new hardware, or to improve its performance. Perform initial debugging procedures by reviewing configuration files, logs, or code pieces to determine breakdown source, Perform routine system administrative functions such as troubleshooting, back- ups, and upgrades. Diagnose, troubleshoot, and resolve hardware, software, or other network and system problems, and replace defective components when necessary. Write new programs or modify existing programs to meet customer requirements, using current programming languages and technologies. Select and edit documents for publication and display, applying knowledge of subject, literary expression, and presentation techniques. Review and analyze computer printouts and performance indicators to locate code problems, and correct errors by correcting codes.

Shows relative usage rates compared to baseline occupational distribution in the labor market. We see peak usage in Job Zone 4 (requiring considerable preparation like a bachelor\u2019s degree), with lower usage in zones requiring minimal or extensive preparation.\n\nThe analysis reveals peak AI usage in Job Zone 4 (requiring bachelor\u2019s degree-level preparation), with a representation ratio of 1.50, indicating 50% higher usage than expected given its baseline distribution. Both minimal preparation (Job Zone 1) and extensive preparation roles (Job Zone 5) show lower usage rates, with representation ratios of 0.40 and 0.58 respectively. Job Zones 2 and 3 demonstrate usage rates more closely aligned with their baseline distribution (ratios of 0.78 and 0.94). This pattern suggests AI tools are most readily used in occupations requiring substantial but not elite-level specialization, likely due to these roles involving structured, analytical tasks well-suited to current AI capabilities. The lower usage in both minimal preparation roles and highly specialized positions may occur due to many of those jobs requiring physical manipulation of the environment. For the most specialized tasks, regulations and access to sensitive information (e.g. in healthcare roles) may also play a role in limited AI usage.", "type": "Document"}}
