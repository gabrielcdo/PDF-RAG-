Here, we present a novel framework for measuring AI usage patterns across the economy. We leverage a recent privacy-preserving system [Tamkin et al., 2024] to analyze over four million Claude.ai conversations through the lens of tasks and occupations in the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s O*NET Database. Our analysis reveals that AI usage primarily concentrates in software development and writing tasks, which together account for nearly half of all total usage. However, usage of AI extends more broadly across the economy, with \u223c 36% of occupations using AI for at least a quarter of their associated tasks. We also analyze how AI is being used for tasks, finding 57% of usage suggests augmentation of human capabilities (e.g., learning or iterating on an output) while 43% suggests automation (e.g., fulfilling a request with minimal human involvement). While our data and methods face important limitations and only paint a picture of AI usage on a single platform, they provide an automated, granular approach for tracking AI\u2019s evolving role in the economy and identifying leading indicators of future impact as these technologies continue to advance.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nRapid advances in artificial intelligence suggest profound implications for the evolution of labor markets [Brynjolfsson et al., 2018b, Acemoglu, 2021, Trammell and Korinek, 2023, Hering, 2023, Comunale and Manera, 2024, Maslej et al., 2024]. Despite the importance of anticipating and preparing for these changes, we lack systematic empirical evidence about how AI systems are actually being integrated into the economy. Existing methodologies\u2014whether developing predictive models [Webb, 2019, Eloundou et al., 2023, Kinder et al., 2024], conducting controlled studies of productivity effects [Peng et al., 2023, Noy and Zhang, 2023], or administering periodic surveys of users [Humlum and Vestergaard, 2024, Bick et al., 2024]\u2014cannot track the dynamic relationship between advancing AI capabilities and their direct, real-world use across the economy.\n\nHere, we present a novel empirical framework for measuring AI usage across different tasks in the economy, drawing on privacy-preserving analysis of millions of real-world conversations on Claude.ai [Tamkin et al., 2024]. By mapping these conversations to occupational categories in the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s O*NET Database, we can identify not just current usage patterns, but\n\n\u2217Equal contribution.

We introduce a framework to measure the amount of AI usage for tasks across the economy . We map conversations from Claude.ai to occupational categories in the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s O*NET Database to surface current usage patterns. Our approach provides an automated, granular, and empirically grounded methodology for tracking AI\u2019s evolving role in the economy. (Note: figure contains illustrative conversation examples only.)\n\nalso early indicators of which parts of the economy may be most affected as these technologies continue to advance.2\n\nWe use this framework to make five key contributions:\n\n1. Provide the first large-scale empirical measurement of which tasks are seeing AI use across the economy (Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3) Our analysis reveals highest use for tasks in software engineering roles (e.g., software engineers, data scientists, bioinformatics technicians), professions requiring substantial writing capabilities (e.g., technical writers, copywriters, archivists), and analytical roles (e.g., data scientists). Conversely, tasks in occupations involving physical manipulation of the environment (e.g., anesthesiologists, construction workers) currently show minimal use.\n\n2. Quantify the depth of AI use within occupations (Figure 4) Only \u223c4% of occupations exhibit AI usage for at least 75% of their tasks, suggesting the potential for deep task-level use in some roles. More broadly, \u223c36% of occupations show usage in at least 25% of their tasks, indicating that AI has already begun to diffuse into task portfolios across a substantial portion of the workforce.\n\n3. Measure which occupational skills are most represented in human-AI conversations (Figure 5). Cognitive skills like Reading Comprehension, Writing, and Critical Thinking show high presence, while physical skills (e.g., Installation, Equipment Maintenance) and managerial skills (e.g., Negotiation) show minimal presence\u2014reflecting clear patterns of human complementarity with current AI capabilities.\n\n2We provide relevant data at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/EconomicIndex/.\n\n2\n\n4. Analyze how wage and barrier to entry correlates with AI usage (Figure 6 and Table 2). We find that AI use peaks in the upper quartile of wages but drops off at both extremes of the wage spectrum. Most high-usage occupations clustered in the upper quartile correspond predominantly to software industry positions, while both very high-wage occupations (e.g., physicians) and low-wage positions (e.g., restaurant workers) demonstrate relatively low usage. This pattern likely reflects either limitations in current AI capabilities, the inherent physical manipulation requirements of these roles, or both. Similar patterns emerge for barriers to entry, with peak usage in occupations requiring considerable preparation (e.g., bachelor\u2019s degree) rather than minimal or extensive training.\n\n5. Assess whether people use Claude to automate or augment tasks (Figure 7) We find that 57% of interactions show augmentative patterns (e.g., back-and-forth iteration on a task) while 43% demonstrate automation-focused usage (e.g., performing the task directly). While this ratio varies across occupations, most occupations exhibited a mix of automation and augmentation across tasks, suggesting AI serves as both an efficiency tool and collaborative partner.\n\nOur methods provide an automated, granular, and empirically grounded approach for tracking AI usage patterns as both capabilities and societal usage evolve. This early visibility into emerging trends gives policymakers and civil society crucial lead time to respond to shifts in how AI transforms work. However, we acknowledge multiple key limitations (discussed in Section 4.1); for example, our usage data cannot reveal how Claude\u2019s outputs are actually used in practice, and our reliance on O*NET\u2019s static occupational descriptions means we cannot account for entirely new tasks or jobs that AI might create.3", "type": "Document"}}
