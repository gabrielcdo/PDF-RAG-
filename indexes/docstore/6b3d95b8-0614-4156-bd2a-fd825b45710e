In this work, we only examine tasks that have accumulated at least 15 separate conversations spread across a minimum of five different user accounts\u2014ensuring that a task must appear multiple times across different users to appear in our dataset.

By contrast, cognitive skills such as Critical Thinking, Reading Comprehension, Programming, and Writing had the highest prevalence. However, our analysis captures only whether a skill was exhibited in Claude\u2019s responses, not whether that skill was central to the user\u2019s purpose or was performed at an expert level. For instance, while Active Listening appears as the second most common skill, this likely reflects Claude\u2019s default conversational behaviors\u2014such as rephrasing user inputs and asking clarifying questions\u2014rather than users specifically seeking out listening-focused interactions.", "type": "Document"}}
