We use Clio to classify conversations across occupational tasks, skills, and interaction patterns, revealing breakdowns across these different categories. All analyses draw from conversation data collected during December 2024 and January 2025. See Appendices B, E and F for more details and prompts, including validating the composition of our dataset and how we perform classification in cases with large numbers of categories (e.g. O*NET tasks).\n\n3.1 Task-level analysis of AI usage\n\nUsing Clio on a dataset of one million Claude.ai Free and Pro conversations,4 we analyzed each interaction to map it to its most relevant task category in the O*NET database. Because there are nearly 20,000 unique task statements in O*NET, we create a hierarchical tree of tasks using Clio, and perform the assignment by traversing the tree. Although there are often multiple valid tasks that a single conversation could be mapped to, we observed qualitatively very similar results when mapping\n\n4Anthropic enforces strict internal privacy controls. Our privacy policy enables us to analyze aggregated and anonymized user conversations to understand patterns or trends. We continue to manage data according to our privacy and retention policies, and maintain our approach of not training our generative models on user conversations by default. Because we focus on studying patterns in individual usage, the results shared in this paper exclude activity from business customers (i.e., Team, Enterprise, and all API customers). For more information, see Appendix F in Tamkin et al.

Each occupational category contains the individual O*NET occupations and tasks with the highest levels of appearance in Claude.ai interactions.\n\na single conversation to multiple tasks. We provide additional details and analyses in Appendix B, including for how we map conversations to tasks (Appendix B.1), the hierarchy creation process (Appendix B.1), the fact that we obtain similar results for conversation-level and account-level data (Appendix B.2), and validation of our dataset composition (Appendix B.7). Additionally, we discuss human validation of our task hierarchy classifications in Appendix C and results on cluster-level data in Appendix G.\n\nOur analysis reveals that computer-related tasks see the largest amount of AI usage, followed by writing tasks in educational and communication contexts. To understand broader patterns, we group these tasks according to O*NET\u2019s occupational framework\u2014first mapping them to specific occupations (such as Computer Network Architects) and then to broader occupational categories (like Computer and Mathematical Occupations). Figure 2 illustrates this distribution across occupational categories, showing the most common occupations and tasks within each group, while Figure 3 compares these usage patterns to the actual distribution of these occupations in the U.S. workforce.\n\nIt is worth noting that the occupational classification of a conversation does not necessarily mean the user was a professional in that field. For instance, while some nutrition-related queries might come from dietitians, others likely come from individuals seeking personal dietary advice. This widespread access to AI assistance for traditionally professional tasks\u2014even if the assistance is not perfect\u2014could have significant implications for these fields, though analyzing such impacts lies outside the scope of this study. We discuss these limitations further in Section 4.1.\n\n5\n\nOffice and administrative \u00bb 9 79% O\u2014emeenl@ 12.2% Transportation and 5 . material moving 3, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u00ae 9.1% ar true 2.3% O\u2014_\u2014\u2014n@ 8.8% related Food preparation and : 7 serving related 156 O\u2014\u00ae 8.7% menos eer Business ond franc 5.9% @@ 6.6% Mawar peg | 2x ear Prouien | 20 ee sex Education insertion 5.8% O\u2014\u2014 9.3% ied 0.3% O\u2014@ 4.7% Construction and xe 041 extraction | 94% 41% Installation, maintenance, 7 \u2018and repair 0.7% O\u2014@ 3.9% Computer and 9 9 mathematical 3.4%! 137.296!
