When comparing these methods, we observe minimum correlation values of 0.47 (Pearson), 0.22 (Spearman), and 0.18 (Kendall\u2019s Tau-b). These correlations are calculated only for tasks identified by at least one method.\n\n30\n\nSoftware Developers, Systems Software Computer Systems Engineers/Architects Occupation Software Quality Assurance Engineers and \u00a7 Network and Computer Systems | Bioinforma Computer Programmers Software Developers, Applications Data Warehousing Specialists Database Architects Instructional Designers and | Foreign Language and Literature } Teachers, Computer Systems Anclysts Search Marke Web Developers Administrators tics Technicians Testers Technologists , Postsecondary Mathematicians ting Strategists Top Occupations by Group (% of Records} Avg.

Figure 22 directly compares the prevalence of tasks between direct assignment and cluster-based approaches at different aggregation levels. Fig- ure 23 shows how task prevalence varies across all aggregation levels, while Figure 24 presents the correlation metrics alongside mean squared error measurements.\n\nThe relatively weak correlation at the task level can be attributed to two key factors. First, there is intrinsic noise in the O*NET task dataset itself, with many tasks being highly similar or overlapping. For example, tasks like \"Diagnose, troubleshoot, and resolve hardware, software, or other network system problems, and replace defective components when necessary\" and \"Perform initial debugging procedures by reviewing configuration files, logs, or code pieces to determine breakdown source\" are functionally very similar but listed as distinct tasks. Second, there exists a many-to-many relationship between conversations and tasks (a single conversation might involve multiple tasks) and between tasks and occupations (a single task might map to multiple occupations). This means that uncertainty expands at the task level but naturally narrows as we aggregate upward to occupational categories; therefore, we see stronger correlations at higher levels of aggregation. This pattern suggests that while cluster-based analysis may not perfectly reconstruct task-level assignments, it remains reliable for analyzing broader occupational trends.\n\nGiven the granular nature of individual tasks in the O*NET database and significant overlap between similar tasks, we expect considerable variation in which specific tasks are identified by each method. Figure 25 illustrates this pattern, showing which tasks were identified by each method and where these sets overlap. Figure 26 and Figure 27 show the average number of tasks assigned to tasks at various aggregation levels.\n\n33\n\nCluster Assignment (%) Cluster Assignment (%) 10\u00b0 0 Cluster Assignment (%) Avg.
