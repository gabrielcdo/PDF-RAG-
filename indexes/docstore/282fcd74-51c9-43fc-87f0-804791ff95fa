Focus on how the human structures their requests and engages with the AI assistant. Analyze the interaction according to these collaboration patterns:\n\n- Directive - Human delegates complete task execution to AI with minimal interaction\n\n- Feedback Loop - Human and AI engage in iterative dialogue to complete\n\ntask with human mainly providing feedback from the environment\n\n- Task Iteration - Human and AI engage in iterative dialogue to complete a task with the human refining the AI outputs\n\n- Learning - Human seeks understanding and explanation rather than direct task completion\n\n- Validation - Human uses AI to check or validate their own work\n\n25\n\nBased on your analysis, identify which of the above is most representative of the user\u2019s response. If multiple patterns are present, select the one that is most appears most frequently. If you are unsure or there is not enough context to determine the most representative pattern, return \u2019None\u2019 as your answer. Use \u2019None\u2019 liberally---for only some conversations will this task be possible.\n\nBefore providing your final analysis for each response, use the <thinking> tags to break down your reasoning process. Consider the context, the user\u2019s words, and how they align with the defined patterns. Provide your output in the following format:\n\n<thinking>\n\nYour 2-3 sentence thinking about your decision. Include specific examples from the conversation and mention any relevant user response patterns observed.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n\nYour classification from the list (including only the name of the collaboration pattern) or \u2019None\u2019 </answer>\n\nUsing this information, identify the primary collaboration pattern in the provided conversation. Ensure your classification is the name of a collaboration pattern or \u2019None\u2019.\n\nAssistant:", "type": "Document"}}
