Cumulative distribution showing what fraction of occupations (y-axis) have at least a given fraction of their tasks with AI usage (x-axis). Task usage is defined as occurrence across five or more unique user accounts and fifteen or more conversations. Key points on the curve highlight that while many occupations see some AI usage (\u223c36% have at least 25% of tasks), few occupations exhibit widespread usage of AI across their tasks (only \u223c4% have 75% or more tasks), suggesting AI integration remains selective rather than comprehensive within most occupations.\n\nHow many tasks per occupation show AI usage? To assess the depth of AI integration across occupations, we examined what fraction of each occupation\u2019s tasks appeared in our Clio run.5 As shown in Figure 4, we find that AI task use follows a heavily skewed distribution. Only \u223c4% of occupations show usage for at least 75% of their associated tasks\u2014for example, in Foreign Language and Literature Teachers (75% of tasks), we observe AI usage for tasks related to collaborating with colleagues on teaching issues and planning course content, though not for activities like writing grant proposals or maintaining student records. Just \u223c11% of occupations show usage for half or more of their tasks, as illustrated by Marketing Managers (50% of tasks) where we see AI usage in tasks involving market research analysis and strategy development, but not in activities like product specification consultation or trade show coordination. The picture broadens at lower thresholds, where \u223c36% of occupations see at least a quarter of their tasks with some usage of AI\u2014exemplified by Physical Therapists (25% of tasks), where we observe AI interactions in tasks related to research and patient education, but not in hands-on treatment or home care instruction. This distribution suggests that while AI could be touching many occupations today, deep integration across most tasks within any given occupation remains rare for now. Rather than completely automating entire job roles, present-day AI appears to be primarily used for specific tasks within occupations.", "type": "Document"}}
