However, a key challenge is the size of the O*NET task database we use (\u223c20K tasks), which makes direct classification via zero or few-shot prompting impossible because the full list of tasks does not fit in the model\u2019s context window. We instead construct this as a classification over a hierarchy of task labels (Figure 9), inspired by Morin and Bengio [2005], Mnih and Hinton [2008].\n\nOur approach consists of three main components: 1) creating a hierarchical taxonomy of the O*NET occupational tasks, 2) mapping from summarized, privacy-preserved, conversations to O*NET tasks with Clio, 3) connecting O*NET tasks to occupations.\n\nWe report the specific number of conversations used for each analysis and other relevant metadata in Appendix E.\n\nCreating a task hierarchy The O*NET database contains \u223c 20K task descriptions across all occupations. We constructed a multi-level taxonomy of tasks using Clio\u2019s hierarchy generation step (Figure 9). This process recursively organizes base-level tasks into broader categories. The following details are reproduced from Appendix Section G.7 of Tamkin et al. [2024].9\n\nWe:\n\n\u2022 Embed task names. Embeds tasks names using the all-mpnet-base-v2 [Reimers and Gurevych, 2022] sentence transformer to obtain 768-dimensional vector representations of each task\n\n\u2022 Generate neighborhoods. Group these embeddings into k neighborhoods using k-means clustering, where k is chosen so that the average number of tasks per neighborhood is 40. We group tasks into neighborhoods because the names and descriptions for all base clusters may not fit within Claude\u2019s context window.\n\n\u2022 Propose new tasks for each neighborhood. For each neighborhood, use Claude to propose candidate higher-level task descriptions by examining both the tasks within the neighborhood\n\n9The key difference here is that rather than generating clusters from conversations, we are generating clusters from O*NET tasks.\n\n17\n\nand the nearest m tasks outside it. Including the nearest tasks beyond the neighborhood ensures that tasks (or groups of tasks) on the boundary between neighborhoods are neither overcounted nor undercounted. We require the final number of tasks at the level l to be nl \u00b1 1.5nl, where nl is chosen such that the ratio between successive levels follows nl/nl\u22121 = (ntop/nbase)1/(L\u22121) for L total levels.\n\n\u2022 Deduplicate across neighborhoods. Deduplicate and refine the proposed tasks across all neighborhoods using Claude to ensure distinctiveness while maintaining coverage of the underlying data distribution.\n\n\u2022 Assign to new best fit higher-level tasks. Assign each lower-level task to its most appropri- ate parent task using Claude. We randomly shuffle the order of the higher-level tasks when sampling from Claude to avoid biasing assignments based on the order of the list.\n\n\u2022 Rename higher-level tasks. Once all tasks at level l have been assigned to a higher-level task, we regenerate a new name and description for the parent task based on the lower-level tasks that were assigned to it. This renaming step ensures that task names continue to accurately reflect their contents.\n\nBusiness management, finance, and customer service operations\n\n|\n\nComprehensive healthcare services and medical specialties\n\nConduct scientific research and technical analysis across disciplines Analyze human factors in lunar spacecraft and habitat design Biological specimen examination and analysis Conduct genetic research and bioinformatics analysis Analyze chromosomes found in biological specimens Analyze large molecular datasets [...] Conduct nanotechnology research, development, and engineering [...] Create and preserve art, culture, and religious artifacts\n\n| Create and preserve art, culture, and religious artifacts\n\nDesign, implement, and maintain diverse information technology systems\n\nExecute construction and infrastructure projects from design to completion\n\n[...]\n\nFigure 9: Example subsection of the generated O*NET task hierarchy. Our hierarchy contains three levels: 12 top-level tasks, 474 middle-level tasks, and 19530 base-level (O*NET) tasks.\n\nMapping conversations to O*NET tasks To map conversations to specific tasks, we use this generated hierarchy to perform a tree-based search through our task hierarchy. For each conversation, we first used Claude to determine if the conversation was occupationally relevant. We screen conversations using Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022). The prompt we use for screening is provided in Appendix F. If the conversation is deemed relevant, we traverse the hierarchy from top to bottom, with Claude selecting the most appropriate task at each level based on the conversation content. Through this process, Clio calculates the cumulative number of conversations assigned to each task in the O*NET database. For privacy reasons, tasks with less than 5 unique accounts or 15 conversations are excluded from our analysis. This also serves to reduce statistical noise. Complete prompts are included in Appendix F. We also experimented with multi-class classification allowing up to k=3 task assignments per conversation; results were qualitatively similar, so we report the single-class results here for simplicity.\n\nConnecting O*NET tasks to occupations Each task in O*NET is associated with one or more occupations. To conduct our occupation-level analysis, we map from individual tasks to their associated occupations. To calculate occupational use, we aggregate the number of conversations associated with tasks for a given occupation. In the case that a single task maps to multiple occupations, each occupation\u2019s conversation count is incremented by the number of conversations assigned to that task divided by the number of occupations associated with that task.\n\n18\n\nComputer and Mathematical Acts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media Educational Instruction and Library Office and Administrative Support Life, Physical, ond Social Science Business ond Financial Operati Architecture end Engineering Management Production Healthcare Practitioners and Technical Soles and Related 99 installation, Maintenance, and Repair Food Preparation and Serving Related Personal Care and Service Protective \u2018reneportetion and Material Moving Healtheare Support Building ond Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance ME Accounts Farming, Fishing, ond Forestry EE Conversations 0.0% 50% 10.0% 15.0% 20.0% 25.0% 30.0% 35.03% Percentage of Total", "type": "Document"}}
