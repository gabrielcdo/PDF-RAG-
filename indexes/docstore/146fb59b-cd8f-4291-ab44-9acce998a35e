We find that usage peaks in the upper quartile of wages with computational occupations such as Computer Programmers and Web Developers. Occupations at both extremes of the wage scale show lower usage. For example, waiters and anesthesiologists (low- and high-wage occupations, respectively) are among the least represented in the data, which is in line with our findings that skills requiring physical interaction are least common in our data.\n\nBarrier to entry Occupations in the O*NET database are placed in Job Zones ranging from one to five, categories defined by the amount of preparation needed for a human to perform the duties of a given occupation. Occupations requiring higher levels of education, experience, and training are placed in higher Job Zones. As Job Zone increases from one to four, so does the representation of that zone in our data, peaking at Zone 4: Considerable Preparation Needed, which comprises\n\n8\n\nU.S. Median Wage: $60,070 ee eee Software Developers, Systems Sortwore 3 Software Developers, Aplications Bioinformatics Technicians Percent of Conversations parsent copy Writers 0% ached te Sein ctl ics Nad Stal Sdn 8320. fs 8 7 $25,000 $50,000 $75,000 $100,000 $125,000 $150,000 $175,000 $200,000 Annual Wage ($) Obstetricians and \u2018Gynecologists\n\nFigure 6: Occupational usage of Claude.ai by annual wage. The analysis reveals notable outliers among mid-to-high wage professions, particularly Computer Programmers and Software Developers. Both the lowest and highest wage percentiles show substantially lower usage rates. Overall, usage peaks in occupations within the upper wage quartile, as measured against U.S. median wages [US Census Bureau, 2022].\n\noccupations that typically require a four-year bachelor\u2019s degree. However, representation falls for Job Zone 5: Extensive Preparation Needed, where most occupations require advanced degrees. These results align with our wage analysis which showed high usage in the upper quartile of jobs (e.g., software developers) but low usage at the highest end of the spectrum (e.g., anesthesiologists and gynecologists), which tend to require advanced training. These results make clear that human barriers to entry may be significantly different than barriers to language models. See Appendix D.2 and Table 2 for the complete results.", "type": "Document"}}
