Tamkin et al. [2024] provides more information about our clustering process, including full prompts, hyper- parameters, and other settings.\n\nWe generated clusters from a random sample of approximately 2.8 million Claude.ai Free and Pro conversations between November 28, 2024 and December 18, 2024. Unlike our analyses above, we excluded all conversations that our safety systems deemed abusive or harmful, and we did not exclude conversations that did not appear to relate to an occupational task. We then assigned clusters to their best-fit O*NET task using the same hierarchical process as our conversation-level analysis (for more\n\n27\n\ndetails about the assignment process, see Appendix B). As in our primary analysis above, when a task corresponds to multiple occupations, we split the prevalence evenly across those occupations. We applied the same quantitative privacy requirements from our primary analyses. For more information, see Appendix B.\n\nG.2 Occupational Categories\n\nWe find strong correlation between the usage of occupational categories determined via direct assignment and via clusters at various aggregation levels. When comparing direct assignment to cluster-based approaches, we observe minimum correlation values of 0.95 (Pearson), 0.95 (Spearman), and 0.82 (Kendall\u2019s Tau-b).\n\nWe visualize these relationships in several ways. Figure 14 directly compares the prevalence of occu- pational categories between direct assignment and cluster-based approaches at different aggregation levels. Figure 15 shows how category prevalence varies across all aggregation levels, while Figure 16 presents the correlation metrics alongside mean squared error measurements.\n\nAvg. Cluster Size 50 Avg.
