Here, we build upon our analysis in Section 3.1, providing results on the most common tasks appearing in Claude.ai data. Our results include the top tasks at each level of our hierarchy.\n\nAt the top-level (Figure 11), we see that IT, technology, and associated related tasks dominate the distribution, at nearly 50% of conversations. The second tier consists of creative and cultural work, with tasks related to creating and preserving art, culture, and religious artifacts making up approximately 20% of conversations. Business management, finance, and customer service operations form the third major category at around 15% of conversations. The remaining categories\n\n21\n\nDesign, implement, and maintain diverse information technology systems Create and preserve art, culture, and religious artifacts Business management, finance, and \u2018customer service operations Manage education, HR, and prof development program: Conduct scientifi technical analysis acr: Perform government regulatory enforcement and public safety operations Operate and manage diverse industrial and agricultural processes Manage diverse energy sources and optimize power systems Manage and improve environmental systems. and sustainability practices Comprehensive healthcare services and medical specialties Percentage of Conversations\n\nFigure 11: Most prevalent top-level tasks.\n\neach represent less than 15% of conversations, with healthcare services and environmental systems showing lower representation at less than 5% each.\n\nAt the middle-level (Figure 12), the data reveals more granular task patterns. Software development and website maintenance is the most prevalent activity at about 14% of conversations, followed by computer systems programming and debugging at roughly 11%. System administration, hardware/- software troubleshooting, and document publishing processes each account for 4-6% of conversations. Marketing/promotional strategies, network optimization, academic tutoring, and public relations management appear but at lower frequencies around 2-3% each. Data science and machine learning applications represent approximately 2% of conversations.\n\nAt the base-level (O*NET tasks, Figure 13), we see highly-specific technical operations. Software modification and error correction activities dominate, with tasks focused on adapting software to new hardware or improving performance appearing most frequently. Initial debugging procedures, system administration, and hardware/software troubleshooting follow as the next most common activities. Document editing and program analysis tasks appear less frequently but still constitute a notable portion of conversations.\n\nOur findings suggest that current AI usage is heavily concentrated in technology and content creation roles, with varying degrees of usage across other business functions.
