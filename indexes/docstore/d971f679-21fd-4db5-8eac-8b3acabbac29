The model does not see the shuffle tags when prompted for an assignment.\n\nHuman: The following is a conversation between Claude, an AI assistant, and a user:\n\n{conversation}\n\nAssistant: I understand.\n\nHuman: Please identify which categories best describe the conversation. Consider the provided list of occupational skills. Your job is to identify ALL skills exhibited by the assistant in the following human-AI assistant conversation. You can select multiple skills if appropriate. Select all that apply. Please comma-separate your selections (e.g., \u2019social perceptiveness\u2019, \u2019science\u2019, \u2019writing\u2019, etc.) and provide no additional commentary.

In this section, we replicate our O*NET analysis using a different approach\u2014instead of analyzing individual conversations, we analyze Clio\u2019s conversation clusters at different levels of aggregation. Specifically, we assign these clusters to their best-fit O*NET task and examine how the results compare to our conversation-level analysis.\n\nWe show that analyzing Clio clusters at higher aggregation levels (where clusters contain many related conversations) produces similar results to analyzing conversations directly for many research questions, such as determining the relative usage of AI across different occupational categories. These results suggest that anonymized, aggregated Clio clusters can serve as a reliable proxy for individual conversation analysis, enabling privacy-preserving study of AI usage patterns while maintaining validity. This analysis also serves as an additional robustness check for the findings presented in the main text of the paper.", "type": "Document"}}
