Alex Tamkin proposed the idea and led the design of the methods and analysis. Miles McCain built the underlying technical infrastructure, partnered with Kunal Handa to develop the task hierarchy and assignment system, led the cluster reconstruction analysis, and supported all experiments. Saffron Huang and Esin Durmus contributed key feedback across the project and assisted with the related work section and validation. Dario Amodei, Jared Kaplan, and Jack Clark provided valuable guidance, support, and discussion throughout the process. Deep Ganguli provided detailed guidance, organizational support, and feedback throughout all stages of the project\u2014experiments, technical infrastructure, analysis, validation, and writing. All other authors contributed to the framing, experiments, analysis, figures, or other efforts that made our work possible.\n\nB Methodological Details\n\nTo conduct our analysis, we use Clio [Tamkin et al., 2024], a privacy-preserving framework for analyzing language model conversations. By leveraging AI assistants themselves to surface and analyze aggregated usage patterns across millions of conversations, Clio enables us to systematically study human-AI conversations in the real-world. Clio uses facets to extract specific attributes or characteristics from conversations. Facets can capture both direct questions like \"What task is the assistant performing?\" as well as metadata such as the AI model used to fulfill a request. In this work, we use Clio to move beyond theoretical predictions to understand which occupational tasks AI systems are actually being used for as well as to characterize the nature of these interactions.", "type": "Document"}}
